Rather than clutter that one up, I thought this should have it's own thread. I originally posted these on the Gilmour Gear Forum ([http://zychal.net](http://zychal.net)), and there are detailed discussions going on there about David's 2015/2016 tour rig.

The amps are a Hiwatt DR504 (and a spare) and an Alessandro RBS (and a spare-George Alessandro said David is using two Redbone Special amps on this tour). Based on the Skrydstrup Amp splitter/Interface, it appears both amps are always on. One WEM 4x12 speaker cab with Fane Crescendo 12A speakers for the Hiwatt and one with Celestion G12-100s for the RBS. The third WEM was used to monitor the second guitarist in early 2016, then removed.  
  
These are the current effects used, in signal chain order, as best as I can tell. Which Big Muff is which is still debatable, as the loop numbers labeled on the pedals do not always correspond to which LED is lit on the floor controller:  
  
LEFT MR-10 LOOP SYSTEM  
1\. Effectrode Compressor  
2\. Demeter Compulator  
3\. Origin Effects Cali 76 Compressor (replaced the SlideRig used in 2015)  
4\. Whammy (in send/return of Skrydstrup Amp Splitter/Interface)  
5\. Ram's Head Big Muff (this may actually be the Sovtek loop)  
6\. Sovtek Big Muff (this may actually be the Ram's Head loop)  
7\. Tube Driver #1 (BKB/Chandler)  
8\. Tube Driver #2 (911)  
9\. Tube Driver #3 (911)  
10\. Electric Mistress (with Lehle Parallel L mixer in loop to fix the volume drop)  
  
RIGHT MR-10 LOOP SYSTEM  
11\. EQ #1 Boss GE-7 (only used for Shine On intro)  
12\. EQ #2 Source Audio Toolbox Programmable EQ  
(pre sets are labeled 1. TELE FULL, 2. TELE LO, STRAT NECK 3. FULL V. 4. BRIGHT)  
13\. EQ #3 Source Audio Toolbox Programmable EQ  
(pre sets are labeled 1. GIBSON, 2.STANDARD 3. STANDARD LO 4. SORROW)  
14\. Univibe (in rack)  
15\. Volume Pedal (in send/return of Skrydstrup Amp Splitter/Interface)  
16\. Providence Chrono Delay C (set for 110ms, only used fro Time intro and RTL solo)  
17\. Providence Chrono Delay D (only used fro Time intro)  
18\. Flight Time Delay A ch.4  
19\. Flight Time Delay B ch.5  
20\. Lehle mixer is labeled #20, but this loop LED is never in use.

2016 RATTLE THAT LOCK TOUR - EFFECT SIGNAL CHAINS  
This is just what I have so far, from looking at the loopers and floor switcher LEDs during the songs - far from complete. Taken from Skrydstrup MR10 Loop System LED's seen in the April 11th New York concert I attended, HD videos from other 2016 dates, the televised Wroclaw Poland Concert, and Pompeii Blu Ray.  
  
EDIT - I POSTED AN UPDATED SIGNAL CHAIN LIST WITH THE LIVE AT POMPEII EFFECTS HERE - [https://www.thegearpage.net/board/i...016-tour-effects-signal-chains.1727260/page-7](https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/david-gilmour-2016-tour-effects-signal-chains.1727260/page-7)
