Live at Pompeii
---------------

Fire at the volcano

It is 45 years since Pink Floyd recorded their seminal live film at the desolate Pompeii amphitheatre for a live performance of their album Meddle. David Gilmour returned to perform a one-off concert to a select crowd of about 3,000 people, at the foot of Mount Vesuvius.

Soundcheck
----------

Gilmour performing a signature string bend on his ’55 Fender Esquire – nicknamed The Workmate – one of the best-loved and most prized guitars in his collection. It is the first time since the eruption of Vesuvius in AD79 that there has been an event with an audience in the venue.

Polly Samson is an author and lyricist who has written many lyrics for Pink Floyd albums. She is also a photographer and, try as she might, she could not persuade her husband to take off his shirt to revisit the 1971 look of the first Pompeii movie.

I never had to do any of this stuff when I was 25

Afternoon light

The lighting rig is fully tested in the afternoon before the show, while the musicians take a break to look around the city.

Historian Mary Beard gives Gilmour and Samson a tour of the ancient site. She explained how Pompeii as a provincial town was the 'Shepton Mallet of the Roman World'

Tools of the trade
------------------

Gilmour works through his guitar set-up during the afternoon with guitar technician Phil Taylor. With a mixture of modern digital boxes and vintage pedals from the 60s, 70s and 80s his uniquely authentic live sound is crafted in incredible detail.

![](https://media.guim.co.uk/589080a859a740fbdbaf42be79b6b0f1f3e23478/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg)

The crucially important volume control pedal, which is integral to Gilmour's sound, and whammy pitch shifting pedal in red. The small mirror allows Gilmour to see the visual cues in the signature round screen.

A vintage Electric Mistress flanger pedal, BK Butler handmade Tube driver pedals, the Cali-76 studio compressor, a vintage Big Muff fuzz box, and Boss graphic equaliser pedal.

A pair of programmable MIDI EQ pedals, Vitalizer digital delay pedal, Free The Tone digital delay, picks, and all-important cup of tea.

The complicated permutations of effects are run through a SKRYDSTRUP Midi foot controller, allowing Gilmour to switch different sounds easily from one place.

A pair of acoustic guitars sit behind The Workmate, a Gibson Les Paul and the famous 'Black Strat' – a black Fender Stratocaster, complete with Jimi Hendrix's guitar strap, which he wore at the Isle of Wight festival weeks before he died. The strap was a gift from his wife for his 60th birthday.

![](https://media.guim.co.uk/6d99a71c1fd6cf8b0606e68f153666887889c969/202_52_2198_1319/500.jpg)

The Black Strat featured on Pink Floyd’s legendary concert film Live at Pompeii. The original volume knob was replaced with a Telecaster-type silver knob with a rubber band for easier action.

This was taken off right after the filming in Pompeii, resulting in a small continuity error during the 'night' footage filmed in Paris several weeks later in December 1971.

The crowd
---------

People wait outside the venue before the show. There was a real awareness in the crowd that to be allowed into the amphitheatre for a concert was something special.

![](https://media.guim.co.uk/89609b3d51ce1128f0acf547755bebbc820a221b/0_0_5759_3847/1000.jpg)

Nobody was allowed up beyond the protected central area of the amphitheatre to avoid disturbing the original amphitheatre seating.

Sounds from the volcano
-----------------------

Unusually, there was no roof over the stage, so lighting designer, Marc Brickman, used the walls of the upper tier or summa cavea (higher tiers), of the amphitheatre as an alternative lighting rig, which at times resembled being inside a volcano.

![](https://media.guim.co.uk/d3d9b2e8ba9b9bf6dd837d91c2af6abf4fceff48/0_0_5976_3992/1000.jpg)

Fireworks from the top of the amphitheatre perimeter. Permission was only given an hour before the show by the local fire department, who were nervously in attendance.

Echoes was much requested by the fans given the original 1971 production, but was not on the set list.

Echoes is a musical conversation between two people, Rick \[Wright\] and me. Sadly Rick is dead, and that's a conversation I can no longer have

Gilmour and the rest of the band leave the stage.

_Thank you to Gavin Elder, director of the upcoming film of the concerts, for editing our exclusive audio track from the recordings._
