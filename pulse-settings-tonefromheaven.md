# PULSE (DIVISION BELL TOUR) EFFECTS

In this section I will give a listing of effects used song by song by David Gilmour during the DIVISION BELL tour. Keep in mind that these may have changed from venue to venue. The effects are not in any specific order on this list. It is just a list of effects used from song to song. I've put the songs in the order that they were played on the PULSE video/PULSE CD.

Many thanks to Rafal Zychal for his work and countless hours of looking through DVD's and Video tape, studying the rack unit during the songs. Most Dark Side of the Moon settings were taken from the January 1995 issue of GUITARIST magazine.

13) Uni-vibe (Rack Mounted)

2) MXR Dynacomp

14) Boss CE-2 (1)

Notes: Tube Driver #1 is set to be a volume boost for clean tones and for boosting the Big Muff. Tube Driver #2 is set as an Overdrive unit. 

BOSS GE-7 Eqs A = Bass, B = Mids, C = Treble and Bass 

Doppolas are used on virtually every song, even when not mentioned. Interesting to note that while these are a speaker, David Gilmour seems to think of them as an effect.

All effects were modified by Pete Cornish.
