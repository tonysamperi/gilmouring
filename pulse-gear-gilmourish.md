PULSE and the 1994 world tour sees David using the most complex rig to date the period and it also marks the return of many of his old effects and amps. During the early 90s the grunge movement rediscovers Big Muffs and analog pedals and David also seem to be inspired by the resurgence of the classic pedals.

The decision to perform Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety also meant going back to the album and replicate sounds for authenticity. Despite the grand scale of the stage rig David would rarely used more than 3-4 pedals at once allowing the guitar and powerful Hiwatt rig to shine through.

**Effect pedals, racks and additional units 1994 live performances**

Pedals were placed on top of the racks. All effects are controlled by the Bob Bradshaw foot board.

Note: Pete Cornish modified most of David’s effects for both correct level and impedance matching. He also included several custom features for improved tone and usability, such as changing capacitors to hight temperature, low leakage, types and changing transistors and resistors to low noise types.

– All effects has specially designed separate power supplies to prevent currant interfearance.  
– The Boss GE-7 EQs are modified by Cornish to give a flatter response at zero or flat and a better overall signal.  
– The Ernie Ball volume pedal is modified with a 10k pot to reduce high end signal loss.  
– The Cornish Soft Sustain is an early version of the current SS-2 including a Boss GE-7 EQ with the sliders on top of the box. This feature was never used.  
– The UniVibe has been modified into a rack unit with a 2-mode switch for fast and slow settings with individual speed controls.

Pete Cornish and Bradshaw systems

David’s system was built to be as user friendly as possible with the cleanest possible audio signal, using only quality components to eliminate hums and RF interfearance.

The Pete Cornish routing system in the left rack, is basically 24 send/returns controlled via the Bradshaw footboard, which was modified by Cornish (same board as used in 1987-90). It had individual on/off switches for all send/returns and a microprocessor which calls up presets from the rack units.

David stage setup during the Division Bell tour.  
L-R: Mic stand with monitor mixer and a Heil Talk Box, the Bradshaw foot control board with two Ernie Ball volume pedals (one used as expression for the Whammy effect), far on the back is the main effects rack with the pedals on top and Cornish routing system in the left side of rack. Behind David has his stereo setup with the Doppola rotating speakers, Marshall and WEM cabs.

**Guitar and amp setups**

David used Dunlop Tortex and Guild heavy gauge picks. All electric guitars are strung with GHS Boomers strings (customised set 0.10-0.48) and acoustics with Ernie Ball Earthwound Lights strings.

WEM and Marshall speaker cabinets are mic’ed with Shure SM57 and Neumann U-87 microphones and Doppola rotating speaker cabs with Neuman KM-86. David is also seen using Sennheiser microphones for the main speaker cabs.
