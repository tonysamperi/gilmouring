# EFFECT SETTINGS AND SIGNAL CHAINS

Although Gilmour's 1994 Pink Floyd tour rig seems more complex than his 1987-89 rig used for the previous Pink Floyd tour, the actual setups used seem to be more simplified. The older TC BLD Booster, Ram's Head Big Muff, and Mesa/Boogie used in the Knebworth version of this rig were removed for the 1994 tour. Several new pedals were added, like the Russian made Sovtek Big Muff Pi and the Pete Cornish SS-2 Soft Sustain. This was also the first tour where B.K. Butler Tube Drivers were used extensively for the main overdrive tones and to blend with the high gain effect pedals.

> > > > _I think his general feeling is that while rack effects tend to cover a lot of areas, they don't cover any of them particularly well. He feels that foot pedals such as a Big Muff tend to have more character_ \- Phil Taylor, David Gilmour's guitar tech, Guitar World Sept 1994

Most of the clean and overdrive solos were from a Boss CS-2 Compressor into a Tube Driver set for low drive. An MXR Dynacomp was also used for some clean tones, and to combine with the Boss CS-2 for some light overdrive rhythm, solos, and the _Great Gig_ slide guitar. Although it looks like a script logo Dunlop/MXR Dynacomp reissue, it is actually a vintage MXR Dynacomp from the 1970s with an LED and DC power jack added (the LED script reissue was not released until 2016).

The heavier overdrive tones were mostly a Boss CS-2 into a Tube Driver set for medium drive. David also combined a Cornish SS-2 with one of the Tube Drivers for a blended overdrive that he used for rhythm and solos in a few songs like _Poles Apart_ and _A Great Day for Freedom_. David's version of the SS-2 had volume and sustain controls, a dry mix knob, but no tone control (setting the tone knob on the stand alone Cornish SS-2 completely clockwise matches the tone of David's SS-2). He set the sustain very low, but the mix level very high. David's SS-2 also had a built in Boss GE-7 equalizer, but it appears he did not use it.

The primary high gain effects used were the Sovtek Big Muff and a Proco Rat. Most of the high gain lead solo tones were from the combination of a Tube Driver set for light drive running into the Big Muff. The SS-2 was also blended with the Tube Driver and Big Muff for the solos on some performances of _Sorrow_ and _Comfortably Numb_.

The modulation effects were primarily from a Boss CE-2 chorus going to the left channel and a three custom made Doppola rotary speaker cabinets running in stereo. David used the Doppolas as an effect in his signal chain, as if they were a modulation pedal. Since the CE-2 chorus was only going to the left channel, it was effectively only 50% in the mix. David also had a second CE-2 in his signal on his pedalboard that went to both channels, but it was only used for a few songs.

> > > > _The stage system I designed and built for David Gilmour included two Boss CE-2 units. A line of mono effects pedals feeds three delays, each with stereo outputs. Those three stereo returns are mixed together into one stereo pair. The left channel passes to a CE-2, then both left and right signals are fed to several identical pairs of amps, to maintain a good stereo balance_ \- Pete Cornish

David used a Uni-vibe for a few songs he used it on for the original _Dark Side of the Moon_ recordings. For the Leslie-style rotary speaker effects needed for a few _Dark Side_ songs David used a modified Dynacord CLS-222 Leslie simulator. It was one of the best Leslie simulations available at the time, with a wide stereo panning effect in addition to the treble horn and bass rotor effects. The Dynacord was modified by Pete Cornish to add independant bass and treble controls for the fast and slow speeds, allowing David to get a more accurate sound.

The mono effects rack signal was fed into the Alembic F2-B preamp, then to David's on-stage volume pedal, then into three delay units that output in stereo. A mono MXR Delay System II was used for a few solos where David ran two delays at once. A TC Electronics 2290 Dynamic Digital Delay was the primary stereo delay used. A Lexicon PCM 70 stereo delay was also used for the Echorec-like multi-head delays heard in the _Time_ intro and the 'Syd's Theme' section of _Shine on You Crazy Diamond_. The stereo returns from those delays were sent to a master routing unit where they were mixed together into one stereo pair. The right channel was sent to one Hiwatt AP100 amplifier and the left channel was sent to a CE-2 chorus and another Hiwatt AP100. Other left and right sends sent the stereo signal to two slave Hiwatts that fed the left and right Doppola rotating speakers. The signal also went to another slave Hiwatt connected to a dummy load box for David's Heil voice box, and to a spare Hiwatt.

> > > > _We have an old MXR DDL digital delay unit built into a rack unit. It has a digital readout, but it's really nowhere close to being accurate. Dave likes it because even though it's a digital unit, it still sounds a little dirty, like a tape unit. A T.C. Electronic 2290 is his primary delay -- it's what he uses for most things. He also uses a Lexicon PCM-70 to store the circular delay sounds you hear in songs like "Shine On" and "Time." Because it has a multi-tap function, it can pretty accurately duplicate the kind of echo Dave used to get from his old Binson echo unit._ \- Phil Taylor, Guitar World Sept 1994

shown above - Gilmour revised his #2 Tube Driver settings for a higher gain sound, shown above. These are likely the overdrive settings heard on most of the tour, including the  
_Pulse_ album and concert video. The #2 Tube Driver was used for almost all of the overdrive rhythm guitar and overdrive solos heard in songs like _Shine On You Crazy Diamond,_  
_Astronomy Domine, High Hopes, Learning to Fly, Another brick in The Wall II, Poles Apart_, and _Coming Back to Life_.

Demeter Tremulator, and Boss CE-2 chorus (left channel only). These effects were built into a rack unit dues to limited space on the pedal board.

Shown above are all of Gilmour's effect settings. Note the blue, yellow, and red tick marks by the knobs, indicating Gilmour's actual settings. The tick marks are to ensure the pedal settings are set the same from show to show, something done to his live rigs since the late 1970s. This rig has not been used since 1994, and based on the tic marks shown when it was displayed at the Interstellar Exhibition in 2003, the settings did not change.

He also operates several master volume pedals: one for his 4x12 cabinets, another one for his rotating speakers, another for his voice box and a speed control for the doppolas. \- Phil Taylor, Guitar World Sept 1994

The Cornish routing system mounted in David's effects rack featured labeled LEDs for each effect pedal and rack effect. Fortunately there were audience videos of a several concerts from this tour and some songs in the _Pulse_ concert video that clearly showed the router LEDs for the effects used on most songs. David's complete signal chain was also published in magazines like Guitar Shop and Guitarist. Correlating those and photos of David's pedalboard made it possible for the first time to know David's exact settings, effects used, and signal chain order for each song. Below were the most used signal chains for the tour.

High Gain Lead Setups - in signal chain order

• Boss CS-2 Compressor > Tube Driver #1 (light drive setting) > Sovtek Big Muff > TC 2290 Digital Delay > Boss CE-2 chorus and Doppola rotating speakers

• Boss CS-2 Compressor > Tube Driver #1 (light drive setting) > Proco Rat > TC 2290 Digital Delay > Boss CE-2 chorus and Doppola rotating speakers

Overdrive Lead Setups - in signal chain order

• Boss CS-2 Compressor > Tube Driver #2 (medium drive settings) > TC 2290 Digital Delay >Boss CE-2 chorus and Doppola rotating speakers

• Boss CS-2 Compressor > MXR Dynacomp > Tube Driver #1 (lowdrive settings) > TC 2290 Digital Delay > MXR Digital Delay >Boss CE-2 chorus and Doppola rotating speakers

• Boss CS-2 Compressor > MXR Dynacomp > Pete Cornish SS-2 > Tube Driver #2 (medium drive settings) > TC 2290 Digital Delay > Boss CE-2 chorus and Doppola rotating speakers

1994 SONG-BY-SONG SIGNAL CHAINS AND DELAY TIMES \- The 1994 Pink Floyd tour was one of the best references on how David's signal chains worked and how he used and combined certain effects. Below is my '94 tour song-by-song effects list, with all effects in the correct signal chain order and delay times. How did I get this? To start, David supplied his song-by-song _Dark Side of the Moon_ signal chains to Guitarist magazine for their July 1995 issue. Then back in the mid 2000s [The Tone from Heaven](http://www.tonefromheaven.com/) website published the first song-by-song effects list for the 1994 tour (_thanks to Rafal for putting that together!_). It was an eye opener and taught me a lot. Since then I have studied the effects signal router in several '94 bootleg concert videos (Rotterdam, Torino, Prague, Earl's Court, Philidelphia, Tempe Arizona, Oakland Coliseum, and others) and found there were many other signal chains used. I verified or updated the original list, rearranged the effects in correct chain order, added alternate patches David used throughout the tour, added missing patches and missing songs, and delay times for most songs. Many of these signal chains are probably similar to those used in the _Pulse_ concerts, but they changed throughout the tour. The LCDs showing the delay times could not be seen in any of the concert videos, so I listened to the repeats and matched them using a tap tempo on a digital delay to get the exact times, or as close as I could determine. Many of the delay times are simply matched to the song tempo, so the repeats fall on the beats.

I included the SPC control settings from David red Strat for a few songs where I could see it in videos. In general David set it around round 4-5 when playing overdrive and high gain solos and on 10 for some of his big solos like _Sorrow_ and the second _Comfortably Numb_ solo. For clean solos or solos with a light overdrive he did not use the SPC and he never used the EXG control.

I included sound clips from several '94 concerts for reference, but primarily from the Torino soundboard recording. That is closer to David's live sound for most of the tour than the _Pulse_ mix. You can really hear the wet, modulated sound of the Doppolas in that recording. It made some of David's solos have a fluid, gurgly sound, almost like the were played under water.

Above is David's set list for the April 14th 1994 concert with patch numbers shown. Note that some songs that I show above as having multiple patches, like _Comfortably Numb_, have only one patch number on the list. David could turn any effect on or off at any time, so what I show as a patch above may simply have been David turning on or off specific effects in the current patch. David had a habit of changing effects and settings throughout his tours as he fine tuned the sounds for each song. Sometimes one effect would be changed to another and some effects seem to have not been used at all.

> > Dave performs all of his effects in real time. He likes to have control in case something is not sounding right on stage. It allows him to swap effects and improvise, depending on his mood. He has a very good ear, and is continually changing his effects to get the sound that he wants for any given show \- Phil Taylor, Guitar World Sept 1994

I have not heard or seen evidence that the Electric Mistress or Demeter Tremulator were used, although it is possible that one or the other were used in rehearsals or earlier in the tour, then dropped in favor of other effects. There are tick marks by the knobs showing settings used, but those may have been marked during rehearsals for the tour, before the final signal chains had been decided. Some songs used multiple patches, and many of those are still unknown, so it is possible the Mistress or Tremulator were used in one of those. Also note that the effects router shows a switch / LED labeled Hyperfuzz and the midi floor switcher shows a corresponding switch labeled HYPER. This was for a Boss FZ-2 Hyperfuzz that was originally in the rig. It was replaced with a Boss MZ-2 Digital Matalizer, but a few of the signal chain diagrams that appeared in magazines at the time listed this as a Boss Metaliser. According to Pete Cornish the labels were never changed after the FZ-2 was replaced with the MZ-2. It is unclear if this pedal change happened in rehearsals or early in the tour.

The Doppola rotating speaker effect was used in nearly every song. The only time they were not used was _Learning to Fly_, some perfomances of _One of These Days_, and some performances of _Money_. Some effects were only used for a few specific songs:

> • The Ibanez CP-9 was only used for the _Time_ intro
> 
> • The CS-2 and Dynacomp were nearly always run together for David's compressed clean tones, or both were run together with an overdrive for his light drive tones
> 
> • The Cornish SS-2 was used combined with one of the Tube Drivers for a blended overdrive on _Poles Apart, Money, A Great Day for Freedom_, and _Hey You_. It was blended with a Tube Driver and muff for high gain leads on some performances of _Sorrow_ and _Comfortably Numb_.
> 
> • When David used his Tube Driver + Muff together for high gain distortions, the TD nearly always came first in the signal chain before the muff. The only time it came after the Big Muff (or P-2) was for the _Time_ solo.
> 
> • For some performances of the Comfortably Numb solos David used Tube Driver #1 + Big Muff, and others he used the the Cornish P-2 + Tube Driver #1. For a few shows (Torino, for example) he only used the CS-2 + Tube Driver #1 for the second solo, no Big Muff.
> 
> • The ProCo Rat was used with Tube Driver #1 for the _What Do You Want from Me?_ solos_,_ the _Keep Talking_ first solo, and the dry solo in _Money_. The TD came before the Rat in the signal chain.
> 
> • The Boss MZ-2 Digital Metalizer apparently was only used for _Take It Back_ in one concert that I know of
> 
> • The Cornish P-2 was used for the _Time_, _Money_, _One of these Days_, and _Comfortably Numb_ solos in some concerts. Other times the Sovtek Big Muff was used
> 
> • The A/B/C GE-7 equalizers were only used for parts of a few songs
> 
> • The Boss CE-2 chorus in the left channel was on for most songs. It was simply used to widen the stereo field between the left and right amps. The mono CE-2 that went to both channels was only used for a few songs, like _Breathe_, the _Time_ intro, _Run Like Hell_, and the short piece from Another Brick in the Wall Part I that was played right before part II. It was also used for the part II solo and sometimes used for the second _Comfortably Numb_ solo, but otherwise, it was not used for any high gain solos.
> 
> • Dynacord Leslie simulator was only used for three _Dark Side of the Moon_ songs in certain shows, and a Uni-vibe was used in its place in others
> 
> • The MXR rack delay was only used combined with the TC 2290 for _Astronome Domine_, _Coming Back to Life_, and the end of the second _Comfortably Numb_ solo (when the mirror ball appears)
> 
> • The PCM 70 delay was only used for the Echorec style multi-tap repeats heard in the intro to _Time_ and for Syd's Theme in _Shine On_

THE SOVTEK BIG MUFF - David needed a Big Muff for the older Pink Floyd songs he would be playing on the tour. Reportedly he tried out around 10 different models but ultimately he chose one of the newer Sovtek Big Muffs rather than one of the older USA made Electro-Harmonix models. It was the primary high gain distortion effect used on the tour. David used it again for his 2015-2016 solo tour.

The Electro-Harmonix brand had recently been resurrected and one of the first pedals brought back to the market around 1992 was the Big Muff Pi, under the brand Sovtek. They were Manufactured in St. Petersburg Russia. Rather than use one of the original Big Muff circuit designs, Sovtek revised it and gave it a slightly smoother tone with more mid range, and a fatter bottom end than the American made originals. Those early Sovtek Big Muffs were made in several different color schemes, but one particular version from around 1992 assumed the nickname "Civil War", for its blue and gray colors, reminiscent of the U.S. Civil War uniform colors. This version is numbered as 7A on my [Big Muff Page website](https://www.kitrae.net/music/big_muff_history2.html#CivilWar). Version 7B also used the same circuit, as did the first edition of version 7C, which is nicknamed the "tall font" green Russian.You can find out more information about the V7A [here](https://www.kitrae.net/music/big_muff_history2.html#CivilWar). The Sovtek line was discontinued in 2009 but in 2017 Electro-Harmonix reissued the "[Green Russian](https://www.kitrae.net/music/big_muff_history2B.html#GreenRussianReissue)" version of the Sovtek Big Muff and it is perfect for this sound. In 2018 they released the [Sovtek Deluxe Big Muff](https://www.kitrae.net/music/big_muff_history2B.html#GreenRussianReissue) which is also perfect for this sound, and much more versatile to make it sound great on a wide variety of amps, not just Hiwatts. I highly recommend both.

(left photo) The Sovtek Deluxe Big Muff next to and original Sovtek "Civil War" Big Muff like David used.  
(right photo) A Green Russian Reissue next to an original Sovtek "Tall Font" Big Muff which uses the same circuit as the Civil War version.

Combined with a Tube Driver before it, and chorus/delay after, this Big Muff was _the_ high gain "Pulse" distortion sound. Here is a selection of various Gilmour solos using the Sovtek Big Muff Pi from the _Pulse_ CD and various 1994 audience recordings of the _Division Bell_ tour. Clips in this order: _Hey You, Sorrow, Time, Money, Comfortably Numb_ first solo, _One of These Days, On the Turning Away, Comfortably Numb_ second solo, _Sorrow_ outro solo.

Below are my recommended Sovtek Civil War Big Muff settings when using a Hiwatt DR103/504 or similar amplifier. These also apply to the EHX Green Russian reissue and the EHX Sovtek Delux Big Muff. NOTE - _the knob zero points on the original Sovteks varied randomly from knob to knob, and from unit to unit, so even though we have photos showing David's exact tick marks, they will be completely different on another Sovtek BMP. That said, I have owned one (out of six) examples of that exact Sovtek model, that DID have matching zero points for all three knobs. Based on David's 1994 and 2015/16 settings on this pedal, his is NOT one of those, so the settings I list are based on what I hear._

Tone: 10:30 / 35% (bass left, treble right)  
Sustain: 4:00 / 90% - 100%

TUBE DRIVERS - David used two original 1986-87 B.K. Butler/Chandler branded Tube Drivers. These have popularly become known as the "Pulse" Tube Drivers. The red knobbed one was labeled #1 and the other #2. Both appear to have had identical settings early in the tour. Settings from the end of the tour show that David set the DRIVE and LO knobs higher on his #2 Tube Driver, which I believe is what is heard on the _Pulse_ album and concert video. Tube Driver #1 was used for light overdrive (thythm and apreggios) and blended with the Sovtek Big Muff, or the Rat, for the high gain solos. Tube Driver #2 was used for some of the heavier overdrive rhythm playing, for some lead solos, and blended with the Big Muff or P-2 for the _Time_ solo.

There were several versions of these 1980s Tube Driver circuits that had minor differences. I suspect the circuits in both of David's Pulse TDs were the more common second version from 1987, but there is no way to know for sure. The later _Real Tube_ and _B.K. Butler 911 Tube Drivers_ can also be used for this sound. A common mistake people make is to set their 911 Tube Driver to David's exact 1994 settings and expect it to sound like his did, but 911 Tube Drivers do not have the exact same pots or circuit as the older 1980s Tube Drivers, so different settings are required. You can read more about David's Tube Drivers [HERE](https://www.kitrae.net/music/David_Gilmour_Tone_Building_Tube Drivers.html).

TUBE DRIVER BOOST BEFORE OR AFTER THE BIG MUFF? - On this tour David always boosted/blended a Tube Driver with his high gain distortions. Tube Driver #1 was placed before the Sovtek Big Muff, P-2, or Rat in the signal chain for the high gain solos. That Tube Driver + Big Muff combo was the one used the most. Tube Driver #2 was placed after the Big Muf or P-2 only for the _Time_ solo.

RACK UNI-VIBE - David's backline tech, Phil Taylor, had a Uni-Vibe effect pedal into a custom rack enclosure for the effect rig. Below are David's typical settings, which are the same except for the Fast Speed knob position. The speed control was modified so that fixed slow and fast speeds could be selected via a footswitch on stage beside David's midi foot switcher. This effect was only used for a few _Dark Side of the Moon_ songs.

HEIL TALK BOX - Gilmour used a borrowed Electro-Harmonix Golden Throat talk box for the album version of the song _Keep Talking_ in 1993. A Talk Box is a device that allows you to make vocal-like changes to your guitar signal using a tube that is placed in your mouth while playing. The effect was first popularly used used in rock music by Joe Walsh in the song _Rocky MountainWay_ in 1973, then later popularized by Peter Frampton and others. It has characteristics of a wah-wah pedal, but is much more expressive. David used a Talk Box in 1975 for an early demo of _Welcome to the Machine_ that was never released, but his first official recorded use was for _Pigs (Three Different ones)_ from the Animals album back in 1977.

shown above - Two versions of the Electro harmonix Golden Throat voice box, like Gilmour used on the studio recording

The 1994 tour was the first time David had used a talk box live. A new Heil Talk Box, made by Dunlop, was purchased and modified by Pete Cornish for use in David's rig. The speaker out jack of a Hiwatt AP100 connected to the Talk Box input. Inside the Talk Box enclosure is a speaker. A plastic tube is connected to a hole over the speaker, and the other end of the tube connects to the mic stand beside the vocal mic, where David would place his mouth over the tube. When he played the guitar, the sound vibrations from the speaker came out of the plastic tube in David's mouth. He could change the shape of the sound by changing the shape of his mouth, thus making his guitar have volcalized sounds. The sound from the tube was picked up by his vocal mic. Since David ran the Hiwatt used with the Talk Box quite loud, and the small speaker inside was mid range focused, a dummy load box was connected to the Hiwatt to absorb the low end signal.

> > _The Heil has a tiny horn unit, and if you power it with a 100 Watt amp, there is nowhere for the bottom end signal to go and you quickly burn out the output transformers. So Pete (Cornish) introduced a crossover to remove those frequencies._ \- Phil Taylor, March 1997 Sound On Stage

The Heil is essentially an 8ohm speaker cabinet with a plastic tube connected to a sound hole in the top, but there have been other, more pedalboard-friendly versions of the talk box made that do not require a second amplifier to use the effect. The MXR M222 and Rocktron Banshee talk boxes both include built in amplifiers, so they can be run in a typical pedalboard.

EQUALIZERS - David has used Boss GE-7 equalizers on his pedalboards since the 1980s to fine tune certain guitar tones. For his 1994 rig there were five GE-7s and each was modified by Pete Cornish to give a flatter EQ at the zero slider positions and to reduce noise. It's a minor difference, but this mod corrects the EQ range on the stock GE-7, which outputs a few decibels below the input signal.

One GE-7 was in a loop with the ProCo Rat, so it was always on when the Rat was used for the dry solo in _Money_. There was also a GE-7 built into David's Cornish Soft Sustain SS-2. The other three were set for specific for types of EQ - one for a Treble and Bass boost, one for a Treble/Bass boost and Mid cut, and one for a Mids boost. Each was in a separate effect loop and only used for specific parts of a few songs.

> > Grapic A - This bass boost was used to fatten the clean _Shine on You Crazy Diamond_ intro, the intros to _Sorrow_ and _Time_, and for the dry solo in _Money_ with the Proco Rat.
> > 
> > Graphic B - The mids boost was only used for _Syd's Theme_ and _Great Gig in the Sky_.
> > 
> > Graphic C - The Treble and Bass boost was used for one performance of the _SOYCD_ intro, but I have never found any other instance where it was used.

GETTING THE TONES \- While I prefer the high gain lead guitar tones from the 1988 tour over the 1994 tour sound, there were still some exceptional Big Muff tones on this tour, and I love David's overdrive tones using the B.K. Butler Tube Driver and the Rat. First, let's get this out of the way. David's guitar sound on _Pulse_ is mostly a studio mixing creation that was heavily EQ'd and altered. His guitar sound was very different in the actual concerts. Below is what it really sounded like versus _Pulse_. This sound clip compares a live soundboard recording from Rotterdam, September 4th 1994 (from a television promo) with the heavily remixed _Pulse_ sound recorded in October.

[![mp3](loudspeaker.png)](MP3/CN first solo_Rottrdam soundboard(tv promo)_Pulse.mp3)Comfortably Numb first solo - Rotterdam soundboard/tv promo (first) compared to Pulse (second)

I prefer the actual live sound, but I am assuming that most people want to replicate the tones heard on the _Pulse_ album, not the real Doppola-heavy tour sound. Below are the key elements needed to create most of those tones.

Building the _Pulse_ tones is rather easy if you have a Hiwatt DR103/504, a Hiwatt replica like a Reeves or Hi-Tone, or a similar sounding amp, along with complimentary speakers. I mostly use a Reeves Custom 50 through a 2x12 speaker cab [with a Reeves Vintage Purple and a Celestion G12T-75](PULSE ERA EMG TONE BUILD_TIME_SOLO_CWMUFF_GE7_TD_CS2_CE2_NOVA.mp3), or a Hi-Tone Eclipse cab loaded with Crescendos and G12T-75s. I have also used a Hiwatt DR103 and Fender 59' Bassman comboed with the Reeves or Hiwatt. Some amps, especially those that do not have much mid range, may be more difficult to achieve these tones and require the adition of an EQ pedal like a Boss GE-7 to boost the mids. For the guitar, a Strat with EMG-SA pickups is ideal, and the SPC control is part of the tone mix for this rig. However, any Strat with a hot bridge pickup and a fat, bluesy neck pickup will work, but there is definitely something unique about the SPC control in the EMG-SA set. David would crank it to 10 for the Big Muff solos.

> > [![Alembic F2-B](Images_Secret_Music_Page/Alembic F2-B Preamp-sm.jpg)](Images_Secret_Music_Page/Alembic F2-B Preamp.jpg)
> > 
> > > > Do You Need an Alembic F2-B Preamp for the _Pulse_ tones? - David used the Alembic F2-B preamp instead of the Hiwatt preamps in his 1990 and 1994 rigs. One of the primary differences between the Hiwatt tone stack and the F2-B Fender tone stack is the F2-B uses a 10k mids pot and the Hiwatt uses a 100k, and is strictly mid range focused. David set his F2-B mids knob to maximum and had Pete Cornish modify it to give it more mid range on the top end, similar to the Hiwatt preamp. David also used a high treble setting and the minimum bass pot setting. A capacitor was changed to reduce the bass frequencies that caused David's sound to be too boomy through his four closed-back 4x12 speaker cabinets.
> > > > 
> > > > I had one channel of my F2-B modified by replacing one of the 10k mids pot with a 25k, which aded a significant boost to the mids frequences, and reduced the size of the cathode bypass cap to cut some of the low bass frequencies. I also had a buffered bypass loop added before my Hiwatt power amp to experiment using my F2-B as the Hiwatt preamp. The tone of the modifed F2-B channel was a bit too thin and harsh to my ears. If I dialed the mids lower and the bass higher it sounded better, but then it was not really any different than the unmodified channel. I was only running it into one amp and one 4x12 speaker cab though. David ran his F2-B into 2 Hiwatts powering four 4x12 speaker cabs, plus the Hiwatts that powered powered the Doppola speakers, so his tone was a mix of all those amps and cabs. Through my smaller rig, those mods proved unnecessary.
> > > > 
> > > > The tone of the unmodified channel of my F2-B was not much different than what I could get with the stock Hiwatt preamp to my ears. As mentioned previously, _Pulse_ does not sound like what David's guitar really sounded like in 1994 concerts. The F2-B is perhaps a little closer to his actual live tour guitar sound, but not the sound I hear in the _Pulse_ recordings. In other words, if you have a Hiwatt DR103/504 running into a 2x12 or single 4x12 cab, in my opinion, you do not really need an F2-B to recreate the _Pulse_ tones. Using the right speakers has much more affect on those tones.

For pedals, you need the following:

1\. Big Muff \- I use a 1990s era Sovtek Big Muff or the EHX Green Russian Reissue. The EHX Sovtek Deluxe Big Muff is also a good one, but I highly recommend the EHX Green Russian Reissue. There are also many Green Russian/Civil War Big Muff clones, and there are many other types of Big Muff that also work, depending on what type of mid range your amplifier has.

2\. Tube Driver - I use B.K. Butler/Chandler Tube Drivers and Butler 911 Tube Drivers. There are also various similar tube drive pedals that Butler designed. A modern BK Butler 911 Tube Driver or older 4-knob Tube Works 911 Tube Driver would are ideal, but there are others that work like the US made Tube Works Real Tube. There are also a few similar sounding pedals, like the Boss Blues Driver or Buffalo TD-X. The Tube Driver is used to blend with the Big Muff tone, compressing and EQ'ing it so it has a more warmth and bite.

3\. Boss CE-2 Chorus - I use a CE-2 chorus and a Boss CE-2B, which has the perfect mid range boost for the Pulse tones. The CE-2B has a built in effect level knob to dial in the desired amount of chorus effect. It can even be modified to CE-2 specs as there is only one capacitor that is different.

The CE-2 use in this rig was oftern misunderstood. If you look at the song-by-song signal chains, most of the time David used a chorus only in the left channel of his two-amp stereo rig, so it was not very dominant. It was mostly used to enhance the stereo field between the amps. For a mono rig with only one amplifier, that means you only need 50% of the chorused signal blended in with your clean signal to sound accurate. An effect level knob like on the CE-2B allows you to do this, or you can use a blend pedal with the mix dialed back 50%. There are many other chorus pedals that also work, like a Boss CE-2W, but any with a blend or effect level knob will work best.

David did use a second CE-2 in both channels for a much more dominant chorus, but it was only used for a few songs - _Breathe Reprise_ , the Syd's Theme section of _Shine On_, the intro to _Another Brick II_ and the solo, the _Time_ intro, _Run Like Hell_, and occasionally in the _Comfortably Numb_ solos.

4\. Digital Delay - I use a TC Nova delay or FTT Future Factory delay, but there are numerous good digital delay pedals out there. One with a display that shows the time in miliseconds is preferable. Delay times for most songs can be found [HERE](https://www.kitrae.net/music/David_Gilmour_Delay Time Library.html).

5\. Boss CS-2 Compressor \- I mostly use a Boss CS-2, but there are many others that will work, like the MXR Dynacomp. This is used to compress the clean tones and light overdrive tones, increasing the volume and sustain of the light picking and reducing the volume of the heavy picking while compressing and adding sustain. You can also use it in front of the Big Muff instead of a Tube Driver to add some punch to your pick attack and enhance the string harmonics.

Pulse Clean Tone \- David had a beautiful clean lead tone for this tour. It was basically a Strat tone with compression, delay, and a little bit of chorus. The intro to _Coming Back to Life_ was one of the stand out songs from this tour using that tone. The basic tone is rather simple to achieve, but the large hall reverb from the venues it was performed in, and in the _Pulse_ recording, is a bit tricky to replicate. _Pulse_ was also heavily EQ'd and altered in the mixing stage. Here is the _Pulse_ audio isolated, and what David actually sounded like from an audience recording of that same performance.

![](Images_Secret_Music_Page/CS-2+Dynacomp 1994 settings_sm.jpg)

For compression, I use the Boss CS-2 and Dynacomp, using David's exact settings. You can also use a single compressor to achieve the same effect. For the chorus, I use a Boss CE2-B or CE-2. The long 630ms delay is also a large part of the tone. For reverb, I have tested various digital reverb pedals with spring, plate, room, and hall reverb. The best effect to achieve the big reverb sound of _Pulse_ is plate reverb in my opinion, but below are some examples.

Below is a clip with the same plate reverb settings as above, but using the stereo outs from the Ambi Space into a Reeves Custom 50 in the left channel and 59 Bassman in the right. I turn each effect on one at a time so you can hear what they add to the tone.

[High Gain Lead Tones \- The setup for most of the high gain lead tones is rather simple. A Butler Tube Driver running into a Sovtek Big Muff was basically the core sound, with chorus and delay.](PULSE ERA EMG TONE BUILD_TIME_SOLO_CWMUFF_GE7_TD_CS2_CE2_NOVA.mp3) The Tube driver slightly EQs and fattens the tone before it hits the Big Muff, creating a blend of the two sounds. The remixed and heavily EQ'd version of David's lead tones on _Pulse_ sounded quite different than what he actually sounded like in concert. For reference, here is an audience recording of of Comfortably Numb, the exact same performance used for _Pulse_.

In the clip below I switch each effect on one at a time so you can hear what each contributes to the tone as it is added. I am using a Strat with EMG-SA pickups and the SPC control set to maximum. The amps used are Left Channel = Reeves Custom 50 into a Hi-Tone Eclipse cab and Right Channel = Fender 59 Bassman.

Below is a more simplified signal chain for the Comfortably Numb outro solo, just to show you do not need all of that gear to get the basic tone. In this clip I use a Boss CS-2 compressor, EHX Green Russian Big Muff, Boss CE-2-B chorus, and a digital delay. Strat with regular single coil pickups into a Fender 59 Bassman.

Below is a sound clip demonstrating the difference between the Big Muff and Tube Driver +Big Muff. The Big Muff is first, the Tube Driver/Big Muff combo second.

> >  [![mp3](loudspeaker.png)](MP3/GR Big Muff only_then TD in front of GR Muff.mp3)Big Muff, then Tube Driver/Big Muff combo

As you can hear, you do not really need a Tube Driver to get a good _Pulse_ Big Muff tone, but it is more accurate. Below are Tube Driver + Big Muff sound clips demonstrating the difference between a Tube Driver placed before a Big Muff and Tube Driver after a Big Muff in the signal chain. The TD and Muff settings were identical in each clip. The TD after the muff sounds more overdriven and on the edge of breakup than the one before, but the settings on each pedal can be changed to sound like the opposite.

Below is a clip of _One of These Days_, demonstrating the basic 1994 Tube Driver/Big Muff lead tone with all of the effects in the signal chain, including a Boss chorus in both channels and a second Boss chorus in left channel. The left chorus slightly widens the stereo field and boosts the overall midrange. This clip also uses a different amplifier in each channel, mimicking the style of the stereo rig David used.

[David added a Uni-Vibe effect to his _Time_ guitar solo for this tour.](PULSE ERA EMG TONE BUILD_TIME_SOLO_CWMUFF_GE7_TD_CS2_CE2_NOVA.mp3) It was the only guitar solo on the tour that had the Tube Driver after the Big Muff in the signal chain. This was probably to drive the signal harder into the vibe, which helps make the throbbing phase shifting moduation of the Uni-Vibe more prominent. The clip below uses David's same signal chain and effect settings, but I added a Boss CS-2 compressor in front to even out the signal more. I am using a Mojo Tono Mojo Vibe, which is a high quality replica of the Uni-Vibe circuit.

[The clip below is the same setup, but without the Tube Driver.](PULSE ERA EMG TONE BUILD_TIME_SOLO_CWMUFF_GE7_TD_CS2_CE2_NOVA.mp3) The distortion is slightly less overdriven, but not that different than with the TD.

[There are many other types of Big Muff that you can use to get similar _Pulse_ lead tones without blending with a Tube Driver. This clip is the _Time_ solo played with an EHX Triangle Big Muff, which is a bit more aggressive than the Sovtek Big Muff sound.

Feedback in Sorrow \- Most fans of this and the _Delicate Sound of Thunder_ period of Gilmour guitar tones would probably point to the live version of _Sorrow_ as one of their favorites. Unfortunately it is very difficult to achieve the trademark feeback sound for the intro and outro of the song at low amp volumes. Even at high volume it can be a bit tricky to get the feeback when you want it, unless you are using a Hiwatt and a 4x12 speaker cabinet. One way around that is the Digitech Frequot. [HERE](https://www.kitrae.net/music/David_Gilmour_Tone_Building_1_2.html#Freqout) is an article on how it works.

DOPPOLAS /ROTARY SPEAKERS \- I have not yet mentioned replicating the Doppola rotary speaker sound because in the _Pulse_ mix that most Pink Floyd fans are familiar with, the Doppolas are barely even there. They were very prominent in the live concerts I attended and on most of the audience recordings I have heard, but they were mixed quite low in the September and October 1994 Earl's Court concerts recorded for both the _Pulse_ album and concert video, and the original October 20th 1994 video broadcast. Below is a comparison of the Earl's Court _Pulse_ sound to the typical live sound from 1994. The Boss CE-2 chorus in the left channel is probably the more dominant modulation in most of _Pulse,_ but in the live concerts it was the Doppolas.

That warbly, swishing/sawing sound you hear in the Torino and [Bordeaux](MP3/WDYWFM_Pulse compared to Bordeaux.mp3) clips is the doppler effect of the Doppola speakers rotating. On _Pulse_, you really only hear Doppolas prominently in parts of a few songs, like the intro and outro of _Sorrow_. The rest of the time the Doppolas are mixed so low they just seem to be creating an enhanced chorus sound and widening the stereo field.

The most accurate way to create heavy live Doppola sound is with rotary speaker cabinets, but that is an expensive option, and proper rotary speaker cabinets are not easy to find. A Leslie speaker cabinet sort of works, but it is really a different type of rotary sound since it features a rotary horn for highs, and a rotating bass baffle for the lows, not actual rotating speakers. Real rotating speaker cabinets like the Yamaha RA-100 or RA-200 can create a simlar sound as the Doppolas, but those are rare and expensive. There have been a few Doppola replicas made, but they are also rare and expensive.

(left) Tolerance Sound Revolver and (right) Taurus Electronic Designs DoppleX

Two Doppola replicas I know of are the Tolerance Sound Revolver (built in Spain in 2009, now discontinued) and the Taurus Electronic Design DoppleX (built in 2020). There were two versions of the Revolver, which featured Mercury connector contacts for the revolving speakers and 100w speakers, similar to David's originals. The P16 model had a single 6" speaker and the P26 had two 6" speakers. Similarly, the DoppleX DX16 model had a single 6" 100w speaker and the DX26 model had two. Both of these are simply speaker cabinets, so they have to be fed a signal from an amplifier just like any other speaker cabinet. There is no built in amplification. Although a single rotating speaker sounds good when combined with the sound from another amplifier and normal speaker cabinet, you really need two sets of rotary speakers, each running at different speeds, to replicate David's out-of-sync Doppola sound, which usually had an always changing doppola effect.

For most people, a better option for either the heavy live rotary sound, or the lighter Pulse rotary sound, is a chorus or rotary pedal. In a two-amp stereo setup you can achieve a similar effect as Pulse with a CE-2 or CE-2W chorus in front of each amp, last in the signal chain, or with a CE-2/CE-2W going to both amps, and a second CE-2 going to only one of the amps. In a single-amp mono setup you can achieve a similar effect with by using a Dawner Prince Pulse or a Boss CE-2 or CE-2W combined with a second CE-2 running through a blend pedal to reduce it in the mix to 50%. Or use a Boss CE-2B, which already has a blend knob built in. Another option is a CE-2/CE-2W combined with an Electric Mistress running through a blend pedal at 50% mix. Just using a CE-2 or CE-2W by itself works really well also.

(left) Boss CE-2B and Boss CE-2 settings replicate the Doppola sound in a mono rig. An Electric Mistress through a blend pedal can also be used instead of a CE-2B (right)

If you want something similar to the heavy Doppola sound heard in the 1994 tour soundboard and audience recordings, you really need to have a stereo rotary pedal with a blend knob, treble/bass (high/low) balance knob, and use it in a two-amp stereo rig. A mono rig works too, but the effect is much more accurate when you hear it in stereo. The Doppolas David used created a rotary speaker sound like the Maestro Rover and Yamaha RA-200, which have actual rotating speaker drivers inside. Unfortunately, most rotary pedals simulate a Leslie, which has a rotating drum baffle over a stationary bass speaker, and rotating horns over a stationary treble speaker. Leslies create a beautiful, warbly doppler effect, but it is a different type of sound than actual rotating speakers like the Rover, RA-200, and Doppolas.

Settings to replicate the stereo Doppola effect heard on the 1994 tour for the Boss RT-20 Rotary Ensemble, Neo Ventilator II, and Dawner Prince Pulse

A necessary control for a rotary pedal to work for Gilmour's rotary speaker tones tones is a blend knob to allow the dry signal to blended with the effect signal. A balance control to adjust the amount of LO bass speaker signal vs the HI horn signal, and a mic distance control, are also important features. There are several rotary Leslie type pedals that have those necessary controls. The closest for this purpose that I have used are the Boss RT-20 Rotary Ensemble and the Neo Instruments Ventilator II. They are not quite the same as the Doppola sound and both are slightly noisy (hiss), but they work very well. I dial the balance knob on each so the bass (LO) speaker sim is high in the mix and the horn speaker (HI) sim is low (there was no horn in the Doppola speaker cabinets). The RT-20 has an effect level mix knob to allow you to dial in the desired amount of rotary sound to mix in with your dry signal. The Ventilator II has mix knobs for both the LO and HI speakers to do the same thing. The Dawner Prince Pulse also has the necessary controls for this effect and sounds exceptionally good. However, instead of two rotor sounds running simultaneously like the Vent and RT-20, the Pulse only has a single rotor, so the sound is not as rich and complex.

Using the mix knob, I usually blend the effect in around 35-40% for the 1994 tour sound, and 20-25% for the _Pulse_ live album sound. It is also important to set the rotary speed correctly. Nearly all of the emulator pedals have a fast/slow speed selector and speed controls. Select the slow speed for just about everything except _Any Colour You Like_. The slow speed settings I use equate to about 90 - 120 rotations per minute (rpm). I have found those speeds sound best. Lower rpm for slower tempo songs and faster rpm for faster tempos.You can determine the rotation speed on a rotary emulator by counting how many rise peaks, or rotations, you hear over a full minute. The RT-20 has LEDs that visually rotate, so that helps.

David tended to use slow Doppola speed settings for just about everything. The only clear example of rotor speed from _The Division Bell_ album is the _Wearing The Inside Out_ solo. There is a video of David recording the solo in his Astoria recording studio where the Rover can be seen to be rotating about 85 rpm, or about 1.4 rotations per second, which is very slow. For the 1994 tour the Doppolas in the left and right channels were each running at different speeds, but the rise peak of each rotation of the dominant Doppola can sometimes be heard in the soundboard and audience recordings. I timed the _Sorrow_ intro and outro and _What Do You Want from Me_ to be about about 119 rpm. The _Sorrow_ and _Comfortably Numb_ solos were about 128 rpm. I timed _SOYCD_ to about 112 rpm. Sometimes it was difficult to determine a specific rotor speed because both left and right Doppolas were equally balanced. I can clearly hear two different speeds in some of the the _On the Turning Away_ solos, especially the Torino soundboard recording. I think it is 128 in the right channel and 119 in the left, but the rise peak when the two doppler waves cross over may be skewing the rpms I hear.

Below are a few stereo RT-20 sound clips replicating David's slightly dirty overdrive tone using an EMG Strat and a Tube Driver through a Reeves Custom 50 through a Hi-Tone Eclipse speaker cab (left) and Fender 59 Bassman (right). The RT-20 is last in the signal chain. The stereo delay is set for 500ms and 375ms.

As you can hear, the RT-20/CE-2 combo works very well when using clean or slightly overdriven tones. It also works for the arpeggios from _Us and Them_ and the fast Leslie sound from _Any Colour You Like_.

As you can hear, the RT-20 on its own is not completely accurate to the Doppola sound. Adding the CE-2 chorus enhances the sound, but also makes it slightly metallic sounding. The RT-20/CE-2 combo still works well for most of the high gain Big Muff solos

Below is an example of Run Like Hell with the Boss RT-20. This clip uses two delays in series. First is 380ms and the second is 245ms to create a slight ADT sound to the main delay. I think David actually used the 80ms ADT delay feature of the TC2290 delay for that doublt-track effcct, but either way, it helps thicken the tone.

The RT-20 and Ventilator are very similar, but the Vent has a more Leslie-like sound. Both have a richer and more detailed sound than the Dawner Prince Pulse. That is due to the single rotor in the Pulse, but as long as it is not set too high in the mix, it sounds very good. It is also very transparent sounding and works better than the RT-20 and Vent for very lightly mixed rotary sounds. I think the RT-20 and Vent sound best for the heavy rotary sounds. The RT-20 is probably the most accurate to the '94 tour sound, but I think the Vent has a nicer, more liquid sound at higher settings, as you can hear in this clip.
